# Mytodo

Mytodo is a simple CLI tool designed to be integrated seamlessly into your console workflow.

## getting started
**manual build**
1. Clone the repo
2. run `make` (you must have Make installed)
3. add mytodo to path
4. run `mytodo init`

**easy way**
1. Download the binary from releases 
2. make mnt/c/mytodo or C:\mytodo\todo.exe
3. add mytodo to path
4. run `mytodo init`

This makes a todo.txt file to which you can log tasks using

`mytodo add "task"`

You can see how many tasks you have pending using

`mytodo show`

When you finish a task you can remove them like this

`mytodo done 8`

This tells mytodo to remove task 8 form the list. 

Happy coding!
